# Cognitive Models of Behavior: Classical and Deep Learning Approaches
**By Kevin Miller, Maria Eckstein, and Kim Stachenfeld**

This github contains code for a tutorial on fitting computational models to sequential behavior. 
Maria, Kevin, and Kim have presented variants of this tutorial at several conferences and summer schools. 
It is also designed to allow for a self-guided approach. 

A talk that introduces this tutorial can be viewed at the following link: [Cognitive Models of Behavior Talk](https://www.youtube.com/live/6cxX6M5VFYE?feature=shared&t=2813) 

# Getting started
1. Open the tutorial notebook, which is found at the following link: [Cognitive Models of Behavior Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bt_ELyVppre7_Sz2jz8fy2UwDlEIm_8d)
2. You should be able to view this notebook online in colab, but will not be able to edit it. So the first thing you should do is make a copy (File -> Save a copy in Drive), which you will be able to edit.  
3. You will need to connect your colab to a cloud-based backend in order to run it (Connect button in the top right -> Connect to a hosted runtime). We strongly recommend a runtime with either a GPU (good) or a TPU (better).
