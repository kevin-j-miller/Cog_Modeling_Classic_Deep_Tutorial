# Cognitive Models of Behavior: Classical and Deep Learning Approaches
### [Kevin Miller](kevinjmiller.com), [Maria Eckstein](https://mariaeckstein.com), and [Kim Stachenfeld](https://neurokim.com/)

This github contains code for a tutorial on fitting computational models to seuqential behavior. Maria, Kevin, and Kim have presented this tutorial at several conferences and summer schools. It is also designed to allow for a self-guided approach. 

# Getting started
Open the tutorial colab, which is found at the following link: [Cognitive Models of Behavior: Classical and Deep Learning Approaches](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bt_ELyVppre7_Sz2jz8fy2UwDlEIm_8d)

You should be able to view this colab, but will not be able to edit it. So the first thing you should do is make a copy (File -> Save a copy in Drive), which you will be able to edit.  
You will need to connect your colab to a cloud-based backend in order to run it (Connect button in the top right -> Connect to a hosted runtime). We strongly recommend a runtime with either a GPU (good) or a TPU (better).
